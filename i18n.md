# i18n implementation overview

This is a version of the i18n for the PSP that follows some of the concepts discussed during i18n meetings. We've described some of the decisions we made.
 
### Summary:
* We are using the same mechanism for both the main and the renderer processes that includes:
* A single component that provides messages to all components that require such by using distributeOptions blocks
* This component is backed up by a single “Mega bundle” that is compiled using all available bundles for the different locales. Bundles are searched for and loaded from a given list of directories.
* In the renderer process locale change are propagated via IPC
 
### Details for the PSP i18n architecture decisions:
* Bundles
    * message keys follow the format: `<component_name>_label`
    * support for loading **multiple bundles for the same locale**
 
* Mega Bundle (Bundles compiling)
    * generated from all existing bundle files in the selected directories. It has the following format: `{ <locale>: {<messages>}, en: { <component name>_message1: value, ... }, en_us: {}, bg: {} }`
    * **generated with a Grunt task** which is executed before the application starts
    * different bundles are merged as follows:
        * bundles from all provided folders are collected
        * bundles for each locale are merged sequentially into a single object, i.e. this object contains all messages for the given locale
            * in case of a **key collision**, the value from the last bundle will be used
            * order of merging is not guaranteed
            * this algorithm is not currently configurable, as it is done using a Grunt task with a configuration specified in its Gruntfile
  	* **Fallback:** in case keys are missing they will be search for in the other locales. See the [Fallback mechanism](#fallback-mechanism) section for more details
 
* Mechanism for messages usage
    * a single grade is added to the root component of a tree which contains i18n-able components
    * this grade is responsible for loading the already generated mega bundle
    * the messages for the current locale are kept in its model( `model: { messages: {} }` ).These messages:
        * are collected from the loaded mega bundle
        * in order to ease distribution, they are **grouped by component name**, e.g. `{ messages: {en: { <component>: { message1: value1, ... } } } }`. Components’ names are extracted from the message keys
        * are updated when the locale changes
    * Distributes messages to interested components:
        * All interested components have a `messages` object in their model which holds the messages used throughout the components
        * once the locale is changed, messages of interested components are updated
        * this update can be intercepted in a model listener in order to make the necessary changes to the UI
        * it is accomplished through the usage of distributeOptions. [Ref.](https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/GPII-2894/src/common/messageBundles.js#L201)
    * it uses the fallback mechanism of the bundle compiler
 
 
 
#### Fallback mechanism
 
The following mechanism is currently used to supplement an incomplete set of bundles for a given locale:
missing keys for a given locale are searched for sequentially first in one or more less specific locales (if such exist) and finally in the default locale.
 
Let’s illustrate this with an example:
 Let’s say we have bundles for three of the `en` locale variations (en_us, en_ca and en itself) and a default bundle of `bg`, which look like:
```
bg: {
    "gpii_app_component1_label1": "label_bg_1",
    "gpii_app_component2_label1": "label_bg_2",
    "gpii_app_component3_label1": "label_bg_3",
},
en: {
    "gpii_app_component1_label1": "label1",
    "gpii_app_component2_label1": "label2",
},
en-us: {
    "gpii_app_component2_label1": "label_us_2"
},
en-ca: {
    "gpii_app_component1_label1": "label_ca_1",
    "gpii_app_component3_label1": "label_ca_3",
}
```
Two keys are missing in the en_us locale (`gpii_app_component1_label1` and `gpii_app_component3_label1`) which will be i) first looked for in the `en` locale and in case a key is missing there, ii) the `bg` will be used as it is the default locale. ([Ref.](https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/43/files#diff-6bc17c73bd5dc975645963854a8c475dR47))
 
So the resulting (compiled) bundle would look like:
```
{
   bg: {
       "gpii_app_component1_label1": "label_bg_1",
       "gpii_app_component2_label1": "label_bg_2",
       "gpii_app_component3_label1": "label_bg_3",
   },
    en: {
        "gpii_app_component1_label1": "label1",
        "gpii_app_component2_label1": "label2",
        "gpii_app_component3_label1": "label_bg_3",
    },
    en-us: {
        "gpii_app_component1_label1": "label1",
        "gpii_app_component2_label1": "label_us_2",
        "gpii_app_component3_label1": "label_bg_3",
    },
    en-ca: {
        "gpii_app_component1_label1": "label_ca_1",
        "gpii_app_component2_label1": "label2",
        "gpii_app_component3_label1": "label_ca_3"
    }   
}
```
As we can see the `gpii_app_component1_label1` is loaded from the `en` locale, whereas for the `gpii_app_component2_label1` key the `bg` bundle is used.
 
 
Let’s look at a different example that describes the behaviour when multiple of the same specificity locales (e.g. es_bo and es_co) are present:
Let’s have bundles for the locales `es_bo`, `es_co` and **none for the default locale** (e.g. `en`). As we are missing bundles for both the more generic locale `es` and the default locale, in case we have a missing key in the `es_bo` locale, the key won't be look for in the `es_co` locale as it is **of the same generality**. Regardless of the key being present in the `es_co` locale, **it will NOT be used** for the `es_bo`, resulting in an empty key.
```
es_bo: {
    key1: "label1"
},
es_co: {
    key1: "label1",
    key2: "label2"
}
```
will result in:
 
```
{
    es_bo: {
        key1: "label1"
    },
    es_co: {
        key1: "label1",
        key2: "label2"
    }
}
```
