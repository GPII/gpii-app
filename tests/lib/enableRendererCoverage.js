/*
 * - Run coverage server (gpii.testem.coverage.express) that will collect the renderer's coverage data
 * - Ensure all BrowserWindows are loading instrumented code to introduce coverage collecting in the renderer processes' code
 * - Ensure dialogs (BrowserWindows) are not destroyed before their coverage is collected
 *     - currently the only dialogs that are being destroyed are the `destroyOnClose` dialogs and we simply prevent
 *     their destruction until their coverage is collected which is done at the end of a test sequence;
 *     - this is done by disabling both their mechanism for getting destroyed by being closed and getting destroyed with
 *     their wrapping component destruction;
 *     - Note that we don't destroy every dialog in the final step but only the ones that are `destroyOnClose` and have their
 *     wrapping component destroyed. The reason behind this is that these components might be used in some post
 *     test sequence code execution;
 * - Collect coverage data from BrowserWindows after every test sequence and destroy postponed dialogs
 *     - this is needed as we need to collect coverage data before the BrowserWindows are destroyed;
 *     - once a test sequence has finished snippet in all running BrowserWindows is executed - this sends coverage data
 *       to the running coverage server which stores this BrowserWindow coverage information;
 *     - Note that single BrowserWindows type (e.g. QSS) would get multiple coverage data
 *       reports (for every test sequence) that might test different elements of the renderer code. These coverage files
 *       are then merged by "istanbul" (nyc) in the final coverage report.
