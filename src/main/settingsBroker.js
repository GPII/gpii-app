/**
 * Settings Broker - Postpone settings applying
 *
 * Introduces component that serves as a "broker" for the communication bettween the PcpChannel and the PSP itself. It postpones sending of a setting change, in case the later requires OS or Application restart. It provides mechanism for undo as well as applying of all such "pending" setting changes.

/**
 * A component which orchestrates the modification of user settings. There are two
 * groups of settings - the first consists of settings for which value changes are
 * immediately reflected. They have "liveness" which is either "live" or "liveRestart".
 * The second group houses settings whose value modifications will be applied in the
 * future after an explicit user confirmation. They have liveness which is either
 * "manualRestart" (i.e. the corresponding application must be restarted in order for
 * the setting to be applied) or "OSRestart" (the whole OS must be restarted).
 *
 * The `pendingChanges` array in the component's model contains descriptors of settings
 * from the second group (i.e. whose application is delayed).
