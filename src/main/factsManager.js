/**
 * This component is responsible for retrieving, storing and updating (when applicable)
 * application facts. A fact is a piece of application information which may be of interest
 * to the survey trigger manager. Definitions of survey trigger conditions will typically
 * include a fact and the value which this fact must have in order to consider the condition
 * satisfied.
 *
 * There will be two types of facts in the PSP: static and dynamic. A static fact does not
 * change once it is retrieved (e.g. keyedInTimestamp) whereas a dynamic factâ€™s state will
 * change over time. In the future, once a user has keyed in, static facts will be obtained
 * from the GPII or will be calculated by the PSP itself (depending on the nature of the
 * fact) and (model) listeners will be registered for the dynamic facts.
